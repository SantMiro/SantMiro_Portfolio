## [Project 1: Image Classifier](https://github.com/SantMiro/Image_Classifier)

This GitHub project is a personal endeavor aimed at exploring the classification of AI-generated images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is trained to discern between three distinct classes:  DALL-E-2 - generated images, Stable Diffusion-generated images, and Human-made images. 

The DALL-E-2 - generated images were scraped from the source [DALL-E 2 Gallery](https://dalle2.gallery).
The Stable Diffusion-generated images were accessed from [DB Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/poloclub/diffusiondb).
The Human-generated images were both scraped from google and accessed from the source [DB Human Generated](https://huggingface.co/datasets/poloclub/diffusiondb).
